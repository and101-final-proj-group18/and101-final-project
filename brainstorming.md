Here are our evaluations of the top 3 apps: restaurant recommender (R), news app (N) and music recommender (M). We will add a point for every category where we think each app could excel:
- **Category:** The app's respective categories would be food and drink, news, and entertainment
    - R=1, N=1, M=1
- **Mobile:** the restaurant recommender's app experience would be uniquely mobile because it would be easy to filter and read when on-the-go, which happens a lot when someone is looking for a place to eat. The music recommender's app experience would be uniquely mobile because it will also allow someone to easily check their recommendations without constantly logging in like you would do on a website. The news app might not be uniquely mobile because everything it would entail could also be done on a website.
    - R=2, N=1, M=2
- **Story:** The restaurant app is useful because users can filter by cuisine and see the price range and yelp rating for each app so users know they are going to a good place. The music recommender app is useful because it allows people to listen to new music based on their previous tastes. The news app is useful because it allows all news from all different sources to be in one place.
    - R=3, N=2, M=3
- **Market:** All apps are meant for anyone from age-groups 13+
    - R=4, N=3, M=4
- **Habit:** None of these apps are habit forming or addicting
    - R=5, N=4, M=5
- **Scope:** We believe the recommender app will have a good amount of technical challenge since none of us have worked with a the Yelp API, and a stripped down version of the app should be easy to complete by the deadline. It might be harder to do this with the Spotify API for the music recommender app because the Spotify API is harder to work with.
    - R=6, N=5, M=5

After evaluating based on the given criteria, the restaurant recommender scored the highest points and we decided to go with that.
