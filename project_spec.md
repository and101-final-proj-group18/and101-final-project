## App Overview

### Description 

Tired of not being able to choose a place to eat that satisfies your cravings? Bored of eating at the same places over and over again? Meet NearbyEats, the app that helps you broaden your eating horizons and introduces you to the restaurants near you that you might not know! You can filter by cuisine, price range and more!

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** the app's category would be food and drink
- **Mobile:** the app's experience would be uniquely mobile because it would be easy to filter and read when on-the-go, which happens a lot when someone is looking for a place to eat
- **Story:** The app is useful because users can filter by cuisine and see the price range and yelp rating for each app so users know they are going to a good place
- **Market:** The app is meant for anyone from all age-groups
- **Habit:** The app is not habit forming or addictive 
- **Scope:** This app will have a good amount of technical challenge since none of us have worked with a complicated API like this before, and a stripped down version of the app should be easy to complete by the deadline
